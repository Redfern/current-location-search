# Current location search

This is the code for getting latitude, longitude and address details for your current location and also the same for specifying a location.

This works with google maps and will require javascript to use.

On line 3 you need to replace **INPUT-YOUR-KEY-HERE** with your own key from google.

You can get a key from https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key if you don't have one
